bercoff_sim:

Tool can simulate the displacement field in a viscoelastic medium generated by a 4D forcing function (1D in time, 3D in space). It is assumed that the forcing function is along z and displacement calculated is along z. Tested for Matlab R2017b.



Theory for simulation method is described in:

1. Bercoff J, Tanter M, Muller M, Fink M. The role of viscosity in the impulse diffraction field of elastic waves induced by the acoustic radiation force. IEEE Trans. Ultrason. Ferroelectr. Freq. Control 2004;51:1523–1536.

Steps to Running Example Code:

1.) Clone or download repository
2.) In Matlab prompt enter: displacement_simulations
3.) When prompted select example_HAS.txt or example_delta.txt. Files contain relevant simulation parameters and path to the forcing function shape in 3D
4.) Simulated displacements will be saved in folder ./results

Output: The 4D displacement field u_z(t,x,y,z) in units of meters along with the forcing function f_z(t,x,y,z) and greens function g_zz(t,x,y,z) are saved to a mat file in folder ./results/. Important simulation parameters are also saved.
